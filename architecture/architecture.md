# Architecture
Modern applications generate a large amount and variety of data, across many systems. This data, if harnessed, can be a strategic and tactical asset. Please speak to the design of a data pipeline that would facilitate getting value from such data. Some elements we would like to hear about include:
## Extraction, transformation, loading and integration

## Enrichment and extension (semantic layer)
## Mitigating risk / single source of truth
## Scalability, availability and security
## Orchestration / workflow / performance
## Monitoring (failure, optimization, etc.)
